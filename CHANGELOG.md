## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- Named environment presets (`local`, `staging`, `prod`) selectable via `--env` flag or `WEBCAKE_ENV` variable, defaulting to `prod` so `WEBCAKE_API_URL` no longer needs to be set manually.
- `staging` environment preset added with endpoints `api.staging.storecake.io` / `staging.webcake.io`.
- `publish_site` now returns a `preview_url` field: the site's custom domain if configured, otherwise a per-environment subdomain (prod) or path-based URL (local/staging).
- `login` now captures and persists the `wsid` session ID alongside the bearer token so `WEBCAKE_SESSION_ID` is populated automatically after connecting.

### Changed
- `login` command now opens the `/mcp-storefront` handoff page instead of `/mcp-connect`.
- Production API endpoint updated from `api.storecake.io` to `api.storefront.webcake.io`; app URL updated from `builder.webcake.io` to `webcake.io`.

### Removed
- Knowledge-management tools `sync_knowledge`, `list_knowledge`, `get_knowledge`, `create_knowledge`, `update_knowledge`, and `delete_knowledge` have been removed.
